# Horiseon-Social-Services-Code-Refractor

In this project, I've formatted the intial code for Horiseon Social Services, Inc's homepage to coincide with accessibility features. The following changes have been made to assist individuals view the site without interfering with pre-existing semantics and styling:

"<div>" element designations have been changed to further emphasize differences in content hosted on site. - .header has been converted to a <header> element in html. - Header section has been given a <nav> designation to coincide with the navigation feature. - .content changed to a <main> element and content within has been given a <article> element signify its importance over styling. - .benefits is now an <aside> element to equate with the format and styling assign to it; content has been given a <section> element designation. - Images have been assigned alt attributes for devices and internet connections that failed to load images. - a proper <footer> designation has been given.

Styling and formatting has been coslidated amongst like-minded classes and identificatiions to simplify the style sheet for easier formatting in the future.
